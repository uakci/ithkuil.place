# [ithkuil.place](https://ithkuil.place/)

â€¦is a website whose ultimate goal is to become the one and only place
for all things Ithkuil (or at least links to them) to be hosted at:
resources, tools, weblets, and maybe even computer-friendly APIs and
[databases](https://github.com/Philosophical-Language-Group/NILDB). 

## Technical overview

`./build.sh` converts and copies files to `/target/` as needed, then creates a
Docker image (quite aptly tagged `ithkuil.place`). It requires `bash`,
`docker`, `git`, `pandoc`, `tree`, GNU coreutils, and `flock` (of util-linux)
to run. (These are checked at runtime.) At the moment, the Docker container
just serves static files with `nginx`; however, more sophisticated setups are
possible and should be easy to implement.
