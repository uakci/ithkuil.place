# [ithkuil.place](https://ithkuil.place/)

…is a website whose ultimate goal is to become the one and only place
for all things Ithkuil (or at least links to them) to be hosted at:
resources, tools, weblets, and maybe even computer-friendly APIs and
[databases](https://github.com/Philosophical-Language-Group/NILDB). 

## Building

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
make docker
```

You’ll need `docker`, `pandoc`, `tree`, and coreutils, I think.
