## Development

This website is developed [on
GitHub](https://github.com/uakci/ithkuil.place), primarily by [me,
uakci](https://uakci.pl). Please contact me if you have any questions
regarding the operation of the site, any complaints or suggestions to
make, or if you’d like to run your service/API here (which I’m fully
encouraging of).

All original content on this website is provided under the MIT license
(also see [the LICENSE file](LICENSE)). Other content – specifically,
the mirrors and the TNIL documentation archive – are hosted in good
faith. (Because of this, the source files for this content are pulled in
from an off-site repository.)

The fonts Andika, EB Garamond, and Inter are used in accordance with the
SIL Open Font License. (All three of them are also gorgeous fonts.)
