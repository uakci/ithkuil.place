## Why the hell are there four Ithkuils?! {#wth}

> <span id="iii" />
> The current ‘stable’ version of Ithkuil is **Ithkuil III** (natively
> **Elartkʰa**), published by John Quijada in 2011. A complete reference
> grammar is available on [ithkuil.net](http://ithkuil.net); the
> language is regarded as complete and stopped receiving updates in
> 2015. Having been around for almost a decade, it – as well as the
> design flaws that show upon closer inspection – are fairly well
> understood. This is what most people refer to as just **Ithkuil**.
>
> <span id="iv" />
> At face value, Ithkuil III is a successful project, attaining all of
> the goals set forth for it. Nevertheless, prompted by a variety of
> suggestions, improvements, and criticisms coming from an audience of
> ‘ithkuilophiles’, in 2018, JQ began working on a revamp of the
> language – termed **Ithkuil IV**. The new (and still ongoing) project
> fearlessly adds, amends, and removes elements from Ithkuil III; the
> resulting creation is expressive, powerful, sharp-edged, and arguably
> beautiful, yet regular – and thus learnable (even to those who aren’t
> familiar with the old language’s concepts). The complete, final
> documentation is most likely going to be posted in 2022 or so (at
> which point Ithkuil III will most likely be retired in its favour);
> currently, it is being thoroughly alpha-tested by JQ together with the
> more active members of [the uhailalepš Discord server](.#discord).

> <span id="historic" />
> As you may have inferred from the Roman numerals, Ithkuil III and IV
> are not the first Ithkuils to have ever existed. Quite the opposite:
> JQ had started work on **Iţkuîl** – or **Ithkuil I** – as far back as
> in the eighties. The final version was posted in 2004, whereupon it
> attracted attention from Russians and Ukrainians, especially those
> involved in a pseudoscientific movement known as psychonetics (owing
> to a science magazine article entitled *Speed of Thought*, where
> Ithkuil is partly alleged to enhance the, ahem, speed of thought).
>
> The attention quickly grew into demand for a simplified version of
> Ithkuil I, especially with regards to phonology. This motivated JQ to
> devise **Ithkuil II**, most commonly known as **Ilaksh**, which saw
> the light of day in 2007. However, Quijada evaluated his work
> negatively, forever after referring to it as a failure. This
> experience, coupled with his own discoveries about Ithkuil I, led him
> to finish Ithkuil III three years later.

## Should I learn Ithkuil III or IV? {#learning-choice}

> My opinion is that if you need to pick one, pick Ithkuil IV.
> Surprisingly enough, even though the language is *not* finalized to
> any degree, it’s still learnable and speakable (more so than Ithkuil
> III, even). It is not hard to follow the updates, so you shouldn’t
> wait until 2022!
>
> To learn Ithkuil IV, you won’t need to know any Ithkuil III. Most
> people learn Ithkuil III by proxy, as once you’ve acquainted yourself
> with most Ithkuilic concepts, Ithkuil III turns into a trivial task
> (just a tedious and lookup-intensive one). Therefore, if you want to
> learn Ithkuil III, you may paradoxically want to start with Ithkuil IV
> instead.

## Why exactly is Ithkuil IV easier to learn? {#iv-learnability}

> -   Ithkuil IV is **regular**. Where Ithkuil III opts for arbitrary
>     tables spanning hundreds of random consonantal values (famously,
>     one of those tables has 1728 values!), Ithkuil IV sets the values
>     in a predictable pattern. That 1728-valent monstrosity that
>     Ithkuil III has, Ithkuil IV expands into a **fully agglutinative**
>     3468-valent complex that basically involves placing consonants one
>     after another in a sequence – could you ask for more?
>
> -   Most of its design is **based on a standardized *vowel
>     sequence***. What this means in practice is that almost all tables
>     in the language look the same, but with different captions. This
>     helps immensely when learning since you only have to remember the
>     meaning of a vowel form, not the vowel form itself. In general,
>     the grammar exhibits artistic levels of **reusability**.
>
> -   It is **easy to pronounce** and **intuitively designed**. While
>     Ithkuil III suffers from arbitrary pairings of values that have
>     little to do with each other, Ithkuil IV emphasizes on a single,
>     general structure that doesn’t vary. Most of the time, there’s one
>     obvious, preferred way to do something, unlike in Ithkuil III.
>     (Phonoaesthetic diversity was not sacrificed to achieve this.)
>
> -   Last but not least, Ithkuil IV is **small**. There are fewer
>     moving parts here than in Ithkuil III; there’s no spooky action at
>     a distance that flips the interpretation of a formative on its
>     head. You’ll internalize the most basic concepts of the language
>     almost instantly, and you’ll have a good command of the grammar in
>     a couple weeks. There’s simply not that much to learn, and most of
>     the learning is in the doing. (So come join us and construct your
>     first newbie sentence today!™)

## What documents/resources will I need to study Ithkuil IV? {#required-documents}

> [The newest version of each of Morpho-phonology, Roots, and
> Affixes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ithkuil/comments/nnvuzn/welcome_to_the_ithkuil_subreddit_read_this_first/).
> and, at times, quick access to [ithkuil.net](http://ithkuil.net). You
> don’t need to hold on to older versions of any of these documents
> (unless as a keepsake? Then again, you can visit [the
> archive](4/archive/)).

## And what are they? {#iv-docs}

> In order:
>
> 1.  **Morpho-phonology** is the main, most crucial document, defining
>     the phonology and (roughly speaking) all the grammar of the
>     language.
> 2.  **Roots** is a lexicon of roots – i.e., consonantal forms from
>     which all Ithkuil words are meant to be devised. In loose terms: a
>     dictionary.
> 3.  **Affixes** is an index of so-called *VxCs affixes* – small
>     affixes that derive more complex meanings from simpler ones.
>     (Morpho-phonology goes in depth on how affixes are applied.)
>
> In other words, Morpho-phonology is the reference grammar; Roots and
> Affixes are two dictionaries, without which the language would be
> unusable.

## How do I input all those weird characters? {#keyboard-input}

> For Windows, I strongly recommend
> [WinCompose](http://wincompose.info/), which allows you to type in
> accented characters with great ease by hitting a special ‘compose
> key’, and then an approximate representation of the character in
> question. (For example, ' and a make á; , and t make ţ.)
>
> The Compose key is native to MacOS and Linux, but disabled by default
> – peek into your OS’s settings/configuration to reenable it.
>
> (Note: the underdot diacritic – as in ẓ – is input as !z.)
