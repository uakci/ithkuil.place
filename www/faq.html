      <h2 id="wth">Why the hell are there four Ithkuils?!</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p id="3">
          The current ‘stable’ version of Ithkuil is <strong>Ithkuil III</strong>
          (natively <strong lang="ithkuil">Elartkʰa</strong>), published by John
          Quijada in 2011.  A complete reference grammar is available on
          <a href="http://ithkuil.net">ithkuil.net</a>; the language is regarded
          as complete and stopped receiving updates in 2015. Having been around
          for almost a decade, it – as well as the design flaws that show upon
          closer inspection – are fairly well understood. This is what most
          people refer to as just <strong>Ithkuil</strong>.
        </p>
        <p id="4">
          At face value, Ithkuil III is a successful project, attaining all of
          the goals set forth for it. Nevertheless, prompted by a variety of
          suggestions, improvements, and criticisms coming from an audience of
          ‘ithkuilophiles’, in 2018, JQ began working on a revamp of the language
          – termed <strong>Ithkuil IV</strong>. The new (and still ongoing)
          project fearlessly adds, amends, and removes elements from Ithkuil III;
          the resulting creation is expressive, powerful, sharp-edged, and
          arguably beautiful, yet regular – and thus learnable (even to those who
          aren’t familiar with the old language’s concepts). The complete,
          final documentation is most likely going to be posted in 2022 or so
          (at which point Ithkuil III will most likely be retired in its
          favour); currently, it is being thoroughly alpha-tested by JQ
          together with the more active members of 
          <a href=".#discord">the uhailalepš Discord server</a>.
        </p>
        <p id="historic">
          As you may have inferred from the Roman numerals, Ithkuil III and IV
          are not the first Ithkuils to have ever existed. Quite the opposite: JQ
          had started work on <strong>Iţkuîl</strong> – or
          <strong>Ithkuil I</strong> – as far back as in the eighties. The final
          version was posted in 2004, whereupon it attracted attention from
          Russia (owing to a science magazine article entitled
          <i>Speed of Thought</i>).
        </p>
        <p>
          The interest quickly grew into demand for a simplified version of
          Ithkuil I, especially with regards to phonology. This motivated JQ to
          devise <strong>Ithkuil II</strong>, most commonly known as
          <strong>Ilaksh</strong>, which saw the light of day in 2007. However,
          Quijada evaluated his work negatively, forever after referring to it as
          a failure. This experience, coupled with his own discoveries about
          Ithkuil I, led him to finish Ithkuil III three years later.

      <h2 id="learning">Should I learn Ithkuil III or IV?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          My opinion is that if you need to pick one, pick Ithkuil IV.
          Surprisingly enough, even though the language is <em>not</em> finalized
          to any degree, it’s still learnable and speakable (more so that
          Ithkuil III, even). It is not hard to follow the updates, so you
          shouldn’t wait until 2022!
        </p>
        <p>
          To learn Ithkuil IV, you won’t need to know any Ithkuil III. Most
          people learn Ithkuil III by proxy, as once you’ve acquainted yourself
          with most Ithkuilic concepts, Ithkuil III turns into a trivial task
          (just a tedious and lookup-intensive one). Therefore, if you want to
          learn Ithkuil III, you may paradoxically want to start with Ithkuil
          IV instead.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="learnability">Why exactly is Ithkuil IV easier to learn?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Ithkuil IV is <strong>regular</strong>. Where Ithkuil III opts
              for arbitrary tables spanning hundreds of random consonantal
              values (and I’m sure you know that one of those tables has 1728
              values!), Ithkuil IV sets the values in a predictable pattern.
              That 1728-valent monstrosity that Ithkuil III has, Ithkuil IV
              expands into a <strong>fully agglutinative</strong> 3468-valent
              complex that basically involves placing consonants one after
              another in a sequence – could you ask for more?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Most of its design is <strong>based on a standardized
              <i>vowel sequence</i></strong>. What this means in practice is
              that almost all tables in the language look the same, but with
              different captions. This helps immensely when learning since you
              only have to remember the meaning of a vowel form, not the vowel
              form itself. In general, the grammar exhibits artistic levels of
              <strong>reusability</strong>.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              It is <strong>easy to pronounce</strong> and
              <strong>intuitively designed</strong>. While Ithkuil III suffers
              from arbitrary pairings of values that have little to do with
              each other, Ithkuil IV emphasizes on a single, general structure
              that doesn’t vary. Most of the time, there’s one obvious,
              preferred way to do something, unlike in Ithkuil IV.
              (Phonoaesthetic diversity was not sacrificed to achieve this.)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Last but not least, Ithkuil IV is <strong>small</strong>. There
              are less moving parts here than in Ithkuil III; there’s no spooky
              action at a distance that flips the interpretation of a formative
              on its head. You’ll internalize the most basic concepts of the
              language almost instantly, and you’ll have a good command of the
              grammar in a couple weeks. There’s simply not that much to learn,
              and most of the learning is in the doing. (So come join us and

        What documents/resources will I need to study Ithkuil IV?
      </h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Ithkuil/comments/j5i75b/most_recent_design_documents/"
            >The newest version of each of Morpho-phonology, Roots, and
            Affixes</a
          >, and, at times, quick access to
          <a href="http://ithkuil.net">ithkuil.net</a>.
          You don’t need to hold on to older versions of any of these documents
          (unless as a keepsake? Then again, you can visit
          <a href="4/archive/">the archive</a>).
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <h2 id="docs">And what are they?</h2>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          In order:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Morpho-phonology</strong> is the main, most crucial
            document, defining the phonology and (roughly speaking) all the
            grammar of the language.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Roots</strong> is a list of roots – i.e., consonantal forms
            from which words can be constructed. In loose terms: a dictionary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Affixes</strong> is an index of so-called
            <i>VxCs affixes</i> – small affixes that derive more complex
            meanings from simpler ones. (Morpho-phonology goes in depth oh how
            affixes are applied.)
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          In other words, Morpho-phonology is the reference grammar; Roots
          and Affixes are two dictionaries, without which the language would be
          unusable.
